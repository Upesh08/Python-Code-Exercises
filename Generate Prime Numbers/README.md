# Basics of Prime Numbers 

- In mathematics, A prime number is a positive integer having exactly two factors. The prime number was discovered by Eratosthenes (275-194 B.C., Greece). 
- He took the example of a sieve to filter out the prime numbers from a list of natural numbers and draining out the composite numbers.
- If p is a prime, then itâ€™s only factors are necessarily 1 and p itself. 
- Any number which does not follow this is termed as composite numbers, which means that they can be factored into other positive integers.

  *For ex, the first eighteen primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61.*
