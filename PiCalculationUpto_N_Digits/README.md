## Basics related to Pi (π) 

Pi - which is represented by a Greek letter "π", is a mathematical constant and is defined as "the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle". 
In Decimal form, the value of Pi is 3.14. Being an irrational number, this means that the decimal places will never end and will never be repeated. 
Hence, Pi is a non-terminating and non-repeating decimal. 
For example, the value of up to 100 decimal places is "3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679".

To find the value of Pi up to the nth digit, we will be using the Chudnovsky algorithm (shown below) because it is a faster method to calculate the digits of 
Pi based on Ramanujan's Pi formulae.

Here, ‘q’ will be the nth digit taken as an input from the user. The above formula can simplified further into the below one.
