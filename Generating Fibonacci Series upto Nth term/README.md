# Basics related to "Fibonacci Series" 

- In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 
- Fibonacci numbers are named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci.

- The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers:  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and so on...

- The next number in the series is found by adding up the two numbers before it. 

For example, 
- The number 5 is found by adding the two numbers before it (2+3).
- The number  21 is found by adding the two numbers before it (8+13).
