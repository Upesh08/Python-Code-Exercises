#Basics related to Exponential Function: 

e is one of the most important constants in mathematics. We cannot write e as a fraction and it has an infinite number of decimal places - just like its famous cousin, pi (Ï€).
The Exp (x) function is used to determine e raised to the power of x. e has plenty of names in mathematics. We may know it as Euler's number or the natural number.

For eg, If you want to solve ex = 1, you need to take the natural log of both sides where e is the number also called as Napier's Number and its approximate value is 2.718281828.
x is the power value of the exponent e.
